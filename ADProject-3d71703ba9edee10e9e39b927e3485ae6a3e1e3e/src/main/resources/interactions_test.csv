6357,5289,2002-07-23,5,"Nice treat to beat the summer heat! I doubled the recipe and made this for some people who had come over in the afternoon, drenched in sweat and horrified of the scorching heat. They wanted more! Thanks for sharing!"
192972,5289,2007-05-10,5,"We found this to be very good, and we make it often. Kinda healthy too!  And actually I don't peel the apples, but clean them first. More fiber that way and you can't  tell it's there."
28603,31490,2002-08-19,0,"Have not tried this, but it sounds delicious. Reminds me of a layover I had at the Atlanta airport.  I had a ham, egg, and cheese pizza at one of the pizza chain places on the concourse.  About $2.99 with coffee... It was one of the best breakfast dishes I ever had!  (But a strange place to find a delicious breakfast...lol)"
346277,31490,2006-08-27,5,This recipe was wonderful.  Instead of using the precooked sausage I substituted uncooked sausage then cooked and drained it. It turned out perfect!
319943,31490,2009-07-18,4,"We liked this, but the I only baked for 15 minutes and the crust was too browned on the bottom.  That could be my oven, but I haven't had issues in the past.  I too used uncooked sausage, but cooked it first and also added a few slices of cooked bacon pieces.  Tastes like the one at the local gas station.  Thanks for such an easy recipe."
674022,31490,2011-04-10,5,"No leftovers here. As Coleen114 mentioned this cooks fast. 10 minutes total for us till it was perfect brown but if we hadn't been watching it could have been disaster. Ovens vary but we had ours higher up and it still cooked fast. Thanks for posting Aroostook. It was perfect served with fruit salad. Kids and adults alike loved it. We could only find the pizza dough with one more ounce than called for so I made the crust built up a bit. No problems at all. Easily could add or change omelet type toppings i.e mushrooms, peppers,etc. Don't forget to season with salt and pepper. Super all around. Made for Zaar Cookbook game in the community forum. Enjoy! ChefDLH"
296809,59389,2008-06-11,4,"This is an excellent, easy-fix side-dish w/tons of flavor that we enjoyed for dinner w/simple poached fish fillets that really needed to be jazzed up a bit. I did have to use dried herbs & the Icelandic equivalent of the alouette, but it is very close to the real thing. I was a bit unsure early on Re peeling the potatoes or not + cooking them sliced or whole, but eventually opted to cook them sliced & unpeeled which worked well. I did not grease my baking dish & suggest deleting that as the olive oil does that job. The combo of herbs + alouette gives this a very good flavor & the surprise was how much the bell pepper added to the flavor, texture & of course the presentation. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us. :-)"
1232243,59389,2009-04-15,5,This is wonderful and super easy!  I work with Alouette and this is exactly why I love our cheeses. It's just not for dipping!  :)
115964,109439,2005-08-01,3,"I tried this on a turkey sandwish, but I thought the horseradish was a little to over powering."
88342,42198,2003-08-04,0,"You shouldn't be recommending eating raw eggs without a serious warning.  The volumn of the ""BOX"" of sugar wuld be helpfull too."
37229,42198,2004-07-07,5,"Very yummy! I didn't realize my 8x8 pan was dirty so I had to use a slightly smaller dish and less strawberries and cream as a result, but it turned out wonderful! I took it to my inlaws for 4th of July and there was almost nothing left! I only had 2 cups of powdered sugar and it was almost too sweet. I'd definetly not use a whole 16 oz box. I will definetly make this again! Sooooo Good! Thanks for the recipie!"
35526,42198,2004-08-02,4,"I used a half a box of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Not sure what happened but alot of the vanilla wafer crumbs never got wet enough to be a part of the dessert.  Loved the taste though as did  my guests.  I will be making this again but will experiment with the sugar, egg and butter mixture to make it a little runnier maybe."
195984,42198,2005-02-15,5,I have looked for years for this recipe. My aunt made it when I was a child and I loved it. I thought it was called French Strawberry Pudding. I tried to make it from the memory of watching her. It was the eggs I left out. Thanks so much.
545717,42198,2008-05-17,5,"Delicious! The only change I made was that I used egg substitute in place of the eggs, it worked fine. Thank you for sharing this refreshing dessert."
20754,70971,2003-11-24,5,This pie was fantastic!!  Tasted just like a banana split!  YUMMMMMMM!!  I will be making this quite often especially in the summer.  Thank you Julia06 ; )
35106,70971,2005-10-31,5,Big hit with the family! I crushed the oreo cookies and mixed in a little melted butter to hold it together. I also added chopped walnuts on top! It was great!
10678,24701,2002-04-18,2,I don't think there was enough flavor in this soup. I sprinkled it with soy parmesan cheese and that really helped. I will try it again with a stronger vegetarian broth and maybe would not blend it next time because it is not appealling looking when it is blended.
92796,24701,2006-09-03,2,This is an easy & healthy recipe but doesn't really have a lot of flavor.  I might try it again but would have to add a few additions to perk it up.  I've had similar style soups that I loved so I'm a bit disappointed with the way this turned out.
60992,63986,2003-06-19,5,I made this for dinner tonight and the chops were tasty and fork tender! If you are salt sensitive (I am not) I would cut back on the salt and look for low sodium soup. I couldn't resist adding a half cup of white wine and thicken the juices. This was excellent served with rice and chive buttered fresh carrots. For a simple meal that is hardy this is just the ticket!
95743,63986,2004-08-06,5,"A big hit with the meat-and-potatoes guy in the house.  Served the chops with mashed potatoes.  Be sure you don't overcook the chops if yours aren't 1"" thick.  Thanks, Chuck."
37471,63986,2004-10-02,5,Wow....great crockpot recipe!!  The chops were very tasty and so tender!  Many thanks!
92641,63986,2004-10-13,5,"This was excellent. I bought chops that were just over an inch thick and let them cook for a solid 8 hours. The sauce made from the meat and soup was delicious served over couscous. I served this with Roosie's Zucotte (#96811) and we had a great meal.  The meat fell right off the bones, it was so tender and juicy. Everyone here enjoyed this dish very much - thank you for sharing!"
4470,63986,2004-10-30,5,"I didn't realize that this was a crock pot recipe until I was getting started on planning dinner only a couple of hours to go so I made it in a fry pan- reduced the recipe to 1 chop, used the whole tin of soup, 1 1/2 tsp mustard and the full garlic. Browned the chop, poured in the soup mixture and cooked it at 2 element level for the full 2 hours. Perfect and the aroma in the house was wonderfull. I added some broccoli & peppers last 10 minutes, served with steamed carrots Wonderful dinner thanks Chuck"
28649,63986,2004-11-27,4,The pork chops were very tender and tasty.  I was very impressed at how good they tasted.  I will be making these again.  Thanks Chuck.
170780,63986,2004-12-03,5,"A new family favorite - thanks - this is soooo easy.  I also missed that it was crockpot, but with the advance browning, had enough time to cook on high for 3 hours- turned out great!"
233839,63986,2006-04-29,5,"This was really good.  I used 3 boneless porkchops and cooked the whole thing in a covered electric skillet for 1 hour, and the meat was tender.  Served it with brown rice, and the gravy over the rice was just like what my grandmother cooked! Yumm!"
250238,63986,2006-07-19,4,"Yummy pork chops.  Even the fussy husband enjoyed them.  I used reduced salt soup and served it over rice.  Easy, quick and tasty....how can you go wrong. "
276502,63986,2006-09-06,5,I have made this recipe for many years. My family loves it.
201581,63986,2007-04-18,5,"I used 4 boneless chops and the full measure of soup and seasonings. I stirred in a package of Express Rice (the kind that microwaves in 90 seconds) for the last 30 minutes of cooking. Delicious, and the leftovers were even better! Made for Alphabet Soup Game."
75497,63986,2007-06-20,5,"Very good!  This is so similar to one of my favorite chicken recipes (Recipe #204668) that I can't believe I didnt' think to try it with pork chops myself.  I served this with wild rice and steamed veggies.  I just eyeballed the seasoning amounts, so I'm sure I used more than called for on some.  Thank you for posting... it was delicious!"
592866,63986,2007-09-20,5,Excellent! A friend gave me this recipe years ago.  One of my favorites.
252816,63986,2008-01-24,5,"We just ate these for dinner this evening,with spicy roasted green beans and cheesy corn muffins..I made 4 chops otherwise followed the recipe...When the chops were fork tender, I added 1/3 cup chicken broth and 1/3 cup long grain raw rice.And fresh ground black pepper over the chops...The flavor was wonderful and the chops were so tender..My DH said to make more rice next time so I will use 1 cup of broth and rice next time..I will be making this often.Thank U for this great recipe.."
371738,63986,2008-09-17,5,"I used 6 boneless chops on the high setting for 3.5 hours.  The family loved it.  Truly an easy, tasty, ""set-it-and-forget-it"" recipe.  Thanks, Chuck!"
1541726,63986,2010-02-03,0,"as a young married woman i made back in 1970, i made this recipe for the two of us..now we are empty nesters, still working lotsa hours and it is STILL great!!!"
475397,63986,2010-05-01,5,Love this recipe... easy and the pork chops fall apart!! Added sliced carrots to the bottom of the crock pot and served over mashed potatoes.  I  also added more dry mustard and ground pepper to the flour mixture.
451605,63986,2012-02-17,5,"THANK YOU!! This recipe is to die for! MANY years ago I came across this recipe (for my crockpot) and prepared it frequently as it was such a hit. A thousand moves later & with recipes lost, I've been searching for this exact recipe!! It's on the menu tonight & I can hardly wait!!"
2838993,63986,2018-07-29,0,"One of the best old crockpot recipes! I always layer the browned/floured and seasoned chops with thinly sliced potatoes and onions. Also, you can substitute the soup with any kind of chicken broth and a little leftover cooked rice can be thrown in if you have it. This is delicious on a cold wintry day."
804931,67888,2009-03-06,5,"Ribs are a favorite of mine and this looked so good with the two sauces.  This is an excellent rib recipe and the sauces are awesome!  It does take awhile to make the sauces and measure everything out, but the end result is so worth it!  If you like ribs and want something different to make try these!  They are sure to please your taste buds!"
43327,75452,2004-05-16,5,"I love this bread!  I did replace orange peel with lemon peel..I forgot to buy an orange.  I also used mini pans, but it seems I had to bake it a looong time.  Even though they turned out very dark they didnt taste like it.  Thank you!  Will be making again soon."
65056,75452,2005-04-14,5,"Ohhhhhh, the flavor of this is superb.  BF picked this out and I must say I was slightly hesitant about the citrus/banana combo, but now I must say, I don't know why!  They balance wonderfully.  The orange is wonderful and subtle and the lemon added just a teensy bit of tang, both of which go wonderfully with the banana.  I, too, did not use cake flour.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, which worked great and omited the salt.  I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x5 pan.  REALLY REALLY moist and just scrumptious.  My one concern, however, is that I felt it was a smidge too buttery, even to the point of being a little greasy.  I might suggest reducing the butter, maybe to 1/3 cup to remedy this?  I'm going to give this the full 5 stars because it is so delicious and I don't think the very-buttery-ness of this really detracts, just I prefer my banana bread a little more bread-like (I guess, drier? Less oily?)  The flavor though... oh!  Phenomenal!  This is the kind of stuff that all you can do is moan with delight when you take your first bite!  Thank you for posting!!"
217716,75452,2005-07-27,4,"a very tasty bread, I would only reduce the sugar next time as I found it too sweet."
1200732,75452,2009-03-20,5,I tried this recipe yesterday and it turned out really moist and very tasty. The orange and lemon flavors made the difference... Thank you!
1193707,75452,2012-07-28,3,"Not great, just average."
1310146,44061,2011-08-21,5,"I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but tried it anyway. It was easy to make and turned out my first try. I put it on my meatloaf and it was the best I ever made!  It would take some getting used plain on french fries and such, but I use it in any recipe that calls for ketsup.  Even my homemade BBQ sauce!  I did seal it in canning jars and it held up nicely.  I can't say how long the shelf-life is because I used it up quickly.  Hint:  Place a couple strips of bacon on top of the sauce when making your meatloaf for something extra special."
198228,25274,2005-02-26,2,"The fennel and garlic were a bit overpowering, I might try lowering the amount next time...."
247405,23850,2009-04-27,5,This soup recipe was a great inspiration to me. I added  8 oz. fresh mushrooms and used a bag of frozen cauliflower instead of fresh.  I also did not puree the soup.  We all loved it.
255952,112140,2005-10-27,4,I added black beans and corn to this and LOVED it! Goes great with Cornbread and milk!
4470,137739,2006-02-18,5," I used an acorn squash and recipe#137681 Sweet Mexican spice blend. Only used 1 tsp honey & 1 tsp butter between both halves,, sprinkled the squash liberally with the spice mix. Baked covered for 45 minutes uncovered or 15.  I basted the squash   with the the butter/honey from the cavity  allowing it to get a golden color.  Lovely Squash recipe Thanks Cookgirl"
593927,137739,2010-08-21,5,This was a nice change. I used butternut squash and the sweet option using a good local honey and unsalted butter. I did not add salt. We ate this on top of recipe#322603 with Balkan yogurt. I may make this again same option. Made for Ramadan Tag 2010.
178427,137739,2011-12-05,5,Excellent recipe! I used butternut squash and the sweet option. The mexican spice mix put this over the top. Thanks for sharing.
16758,8559,2001-09-04,1,it is not that good its watery would not make again she must have forgot some thing in the ingredients
27381,8559,2002-06-02,1,"Sorry, I agree. This is way to soupy to be called chop suey. I drained off the liquid and then had to spice it up a bit with more soy sauce and pepper. I served with rice instead of bread."
57232,8559,2002-10-10,1,I think she forgot to add some cornstarch to make it thick and more soy sauce  :)
356127,8559,2010-04-28,5,this recipe is basicallly great-only thing i did differently was to thicken the broth-i added 1-tlb-cornstarch -to boullion before adding to rest- and found the recipe great ?i served this on rice -thanks dear for your entry=
54678,76808,2004-02-10,5,"Tastes fab but I did use this recipe as a base and did make changes. I used chicken broth and leftover creamed swiss chard and just realized I forgot to add the butter. I boiled my spuds til done, added the chard then pureed. Returned to pot and thinned with milk. Will definitely use again since I have lots of frozen kale and chard waiting to be used. Thanks"
89831,76808,2004-04-10,5,"Hi sugarpea...made your Cream of Spinach soup tonight for myself and DH...it was so delicious, I am looking to make some easy recipes as I am recovering from hip surgury, and cannot stand to make big meals as yet...this one just fit the bill...just enough for us, and a little leftover...I served this with a small side salad (prepackaged of course), and a crusty roll...wonderful, I will make this again...thank you Sugarpea for sharing...another winner...KC"
50509,76808,2008-02-08,4,"A very green soup. I felt it needed a little something, so I added some chopped onions to the potatoes, which  I liked a lot. This was more like three servings for me, but I admit that we like big servings of soup. I this will also work well with frozen spinach - might be its best use! Thanks for posting."
118163,67547,2003-12-30,5,"Oh my god!!! I can't believe how good these beans were! LOL. I made these for a family get-together when I had the 2 days to make it, and wow, it was so worth it. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will be making it again!"
23479,67547,2004-01-18,4,"Hey Rockinchef, your beans are superb. I did cut back on the chili powder, from 5 tbls to 3 tbls. Really delicious."
700782,67547,2007-12-23,5,"This recipe is amazing! I have been looking for a good baked beans recipe for over a year now and this is it!

I made some modifications: 3 tbl chili powder; I also added about 1/4 of a cup of pure maple syrup; cooked in a dutch oven."
463954,67547,2009-06-04,4,"The taste is great, I too cut back on the chili powder BUT I have a problem with the basic recipe in that it doesn't specify the SIZE of the package of beans.  I finally went with a two pound package and it seemed to work.  The package size should be correctly stated in the recipe."
1585511,67547,2010-04-27,5,"Wow these were really good!  I'm not a huge bean maker so I got confused in certain parts like are you suppose to boil the beans for 1 1/2 hours?  Anyway besides having to cook these a lot lot lot longer than it said, there's definitely no need for us to buy the expensive bush's beans anymore!"
742955,67547,2010-11-23,2,"Very frustrated that the amounts of some main ingredients were not specified in the recipe and now I wish I would have left this recipe alone. I used the amount of beans another cook suggested (2 pounds) which I found to be far too many. The beans took hours longer to cook, a lot more water and the flavor wasn't that great. If you decide to add the amount of beans and bacon to use I will try it again, RockinChef. This information seems pretty important and I'm not sure how everyone else got this to turn out so well."
1361960,67547,2012-07-11,5,"VERY GOOD!! I made a tripple batch for a BBQ-Party! Delicious, Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely use it many more times! I made it in a slow cooker, turned out wonderful! I used a little less brown sugar and chili powder and I put some chili paste in it to give it a little more pep!"
2000074125,67547,2015-03-20,4,"Delicious! Had more of a stag chili flavor compared to the original bush&#039;s baked beans but we quite enjoyed these baked beans and I will save this recipe to use again. Didn&#039;t get the same texture as Bush&#039;s, but still good. I used a 2 lb bag of Great Northern Beans and that worked well - made about 3 Litres in the end. I baked it for a little longer than it said too."
2001063105,67547,2016-06-25,1,"While the taste was great, know that at high altitude you have to more than quadruple the water. I did not know this, so the water evaporated in less than two hours and the resulting mess on the pans was catastrophic. I managed to save one pyrex dish, but the other was beyond repair, even armed with a variety of extra strength cleaners and steel wool. Bottom line, use disposable pans. Also, if you are at high altitude (I live at 7K feet), I would skip this recipe completely. You can't ever get the beans to cook no matter how much water you add, and the resulting mess makes it completely not worth it."
2000360876,67547,2016-08-17,4,Its one lb dried northern beans everyone give it a try that way.
27395,23933,2002-03-30,5,"A bit different, maybe...but these are delicious little candies. Great to add to cookie trays, as they always seem to draw attention and strike up guests' curiosity. Everyone that has tried them has loved them. I store in refrigerator, but let come to room temp. to serve. Simple to make and SO much fun to eat!...my kinda recipe:)
~Manda"
15820,23933,2002-04-01,5,I had been looking for this lost recipe for years!! I also sometimes used to make them with semi-sweet chocolate morsels instead of butterscotch! Delicious!
22015,23933,2002-05-21,5,"Does sound strange, but put all together it really does work!"
13029,23933,2002-05-22,4,"My daughter and I make these in the spring - we mold them into little bird's nests (using our hands) and fill them with malted milk chocolate eggs and/or jelly beans. Thought this idea might be useful!
 I keep them in the refrig. too and serve at room temperature. They're also good to use as 'bowls' for an ice cream sundae. We chop the peanuts before adding them..."
26041,23933,2002-12-03,5,"My daughter and I made these for a project for school.  Strange combination your right but the kids in her 4th. grade class all wanted the recipe ;-) Very good candy, I know we'll make these again. "
72489,23933,2003-05-22,4,"I always include these in my christmas candy boxes.  At first glance the ingredients may sound strange, but don't let it fool you.  These are great."
325304,23933,2006-06-13,5,Great use of the noodles. Kid friendly recipe that taste yummy too. We broke the noodles in half and made smaller candies.
257653,23933,2007-09-29,5,"You bring back fond memories from the early 1980's!!!!  I use to make this a lifetime ago with great family members.  Quick, fun, and definatley a classic!  Thanks for the smile!  :)"
648076,23933,2007-11-13,5,"Thanks for this terrific recipe, I have searched everywhere for this, and finally found yours.  It is delicious and just like the one my Mom used to make. Thanks again"
414776,23933,2009-10-03,5,I have to admit it...I loooove this candy! SUPER easy to make and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't like it (but they were ALL butterscotch lovers!).
126440,23933,2009-10-21,5,Very good and quick.  Made half a recipe and still made lots.
246478,23933,2014-02-09,5,"When I was growing up we called these &quot;Butterscotch Haystacks&quot;.  This such a quick and easy recipe and yet so yummy!  If you have someone in your family with peanut allergies, just leave out the nuts and add extra chow mein noodles.  You can also use different flavors of baking chips if you don&#039;t like butterscotch or what a different flavor.  Peanut butter flavor is really good."
22973,43026,2003-05-22,5,"Grandma Pam,
  Oh my goodness,these were so easy to do,and they were so very good. We dipped them in salsa,and they were a hit with my husband.
Thank you so much!!!
Darlene Summers"
41578,43026,2003-06-12,5,"WOW!  When you need a Mexican fix, this is the recipe to try.  These are so easy to make and really hit the spot!  I love the idea of being able to prepare them ahead of time.  Thank you for sharing this.  :-)
"
44372,43026,2004-02-18,5,"OMG!  If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would!  I loved the ease of prep, and the flavor was awesome!  I wasn't sure which size can to use, and realized that 1 4 oz was not nearly enough...it only had 3 chiles in it. hehe  So I would recommend at least 3 of those.  I made up a green gravy to serve with these as well that I will be posting.  Deeeeelicious!!!"
142658,43026,2004-06-04,5,"I have been searching for this recipe.  My husbands aunt made these once and we all loved them. I loved the simplicity of the egg roll wrapper!

Thanks for posting.  I probably won't make often b/c I don't ever fry things - but I am so glad to finally have the recipe.  These are yummy!"
133625,43026,2004-07-03,5,"How easy and yummy!  I am always looking for a do ahead recipe.  My DH and I ate them for supper but what a fabulous appetizer to share. Thanks! 
 "
162119,43026,2005-02-23,5,"As coincidence would have it, I am certain that I know what restaurant this recipe is referring to, as I frequented the place for many years and always ordered the chilis rellenos.  I was sad to see the restaurant close its doors as it was a common hang-out for my group of friends, but I have tried this recipe and it does a great job of duplicating those crispy ""gringo"" style rellenos.  Be sure to eat them while they are crispy- if you let them sit they will get soggy.  They are especially great when served with a smothering of green chile!"
139760,43026,2005-03-12,5,"Wow, so easy and really great!  After the first two, we didn't roll them in the cornstarch, and really couldn't tell any difference.  We also started thinking about what we could add to give them more zip and what else we could put in egg roll wrappers.  My 17 year old son kept eating and eating them!  Thanks!"
230318,43026,2005-07-20,5,I just started posting reviews but I should have a long time ago for this recipe. I have made these at least 5 times. Delicious.
173443,43026,2005-09-18,5,"I think the egroll wrapper idea is GENIOUS.I made a few small changes.I used fresh poblanos,instead of canned chiles.I sauteed the poblanos with tomatoes,onion and cilantro,and seasoned them with Goya Sazon.I used over-sized spring roll wrappers.I used 2 spring rolls at a time (to keep all of the juicy peppers inside),I put 1 slice of muenster cheese on the wrapper,added a heaping spoon of the pepper filling,added a slice of cheese on top,and rolled it up tightly.I sealed it with a small dab of flour-water paste,so it stayed sealed while frying.These were so quick to put together and everyone DEVOURED them.Whoever made up this idea of putting them inside a wrapper was brilliant.Authentic Chile Rellenos are a pain to make,and these have all of the flavor without the aggravion of peeling the peppers,whipping the egg batter and so on.Thanks!!"
405868,43026,2006-12-12,5,"Chile rellenos are my favorite mexican food! My boyfriend and I only like the crispy ones so this recipe was perfect!!! I have to agree, the egg roll wrappers are probably the smartest idea ever came up with!!! It works so well and tastes so delicious. what cheese have u all found to be the best? The mexican restaurant I go to uses mozarella. OK well this is soooo delicious!!"
221044,43026,2006-12-18,5,"*Wonderful!*  Definately need to buy the LARGE wonton wrappers, and use pepper-jack cheese for flavor.  SOOO easy and delicious.  I served over a pool of left-over enchilada sauce (Recipe #132058) and some left-over Cilantro Creme & salsa (Recipe #125221).  As you can tell, I was ""Jonesing"" for Mexican food all weekend.  THANKS so much for a MUCH simpler and delightful Relleno recipe.  I'll actually MAKE them more often, now that they don't take an hour to construct!"
515278,43026,2007-07-23,4,These were pretty good.  I liked the ease of preparation.  You could also buy mild diced green chilies and grated cheese and put them in won ton wrappers for small appetizers.
416758,43026,2008-02-19,5,"I made mine more or less the way Chef #173443 made hers - and OMG LOOK OUT! I don't think there's much you could do wrong with these, esp if you include cheese! I made these twice this week - once fried and once brushed with oil and put under the broiler (flipped once). Both worked out great! WILL MAKE THIS ONE OFTEN, THANKS!!"
415551,43026,2009-01-15,5,"Oh wow, I remember having this at a little place in Denver called the something Street Dairy YEARS AGO.  They sold for like 90 cents a pop and were sooo good.  It's an authentic Colorado recipe for sure. Thanks CC!"
750280,43026,2009-02-08,0,"I am pretty sure I know which Mexican restaurant in Colorado..I am from Colorado too..(Grand Junction, CO) and if its the same restaurant I know of..I am crushed that they are out of business..? Anyway  these chili rellenos were baked (or maybe the ""warmed up"" enchilada sauce was just poured over the chili relleno) in a mild enchilada sauce (after initial frying) and before serving..and they were the best...I am so glad that Colorado Cookie shared this recipe"
1436178,43026,2009-11-04,5,"I grew up eating these on Football sundays. We used to fry up hundreds for the game and there would never be any leftovers.  Being from CO this is the only chile relleno that I love!  They are SUPER EASY to make.  Super easy to eat. When I was really small my mom didn't put the chile in some just for us kids.  Instead we got a whole lot of cheese.  We used to use monterey jack and/or cheddar.  I prefer pepperjack now because it adds a little extra something to them.  We never used cornstarch (I am guessing that is to keep them from sticking together when made ahead of time).  But they turn out fantastic.  If you are looking for an easy appetizer recipe or just something different these are SOOOOO worth it!
They taste great on their own but any kind of mexican dip/sauce would probably make these that much more yummy!
Happy Eating!"
126440,43026,2009-11-06,5,Loved this recipe.  I only made four as an appetizer with a freshly roasted chili and pepper jack cheese.  Served it with Recipe #95632.
1539827,43026,2010-02-01,0,"I will give these a try.  I've made them, but not with cornstarch.

I'm from colorado, and the Best Chile Tellenos I've ever had is from Gordo's.  It use to be on colfax, then it went to 6th and Sheridan, now it's at 44th and Wadsword.  BEST CHILE RELLENOS IN TOWN!

...I can never get them as good, though.."
329638,43026,2010-10-06,5,"These were awesome!  I used fresh poblanos, roasted and peeled, and should have brined them, as they needed the punch of the brine, but they were still fantastic.  Thanks for sharing one of our new addictions!"
1951766,43026,2011-07-08,5,"Yum!  We're making rellenos tonight and LOVE the egg roll wrappers!  Haven't used cornstarch yet but I'm excited to try it tonight.  We usually use colby jack, mild/medium cheddar AND cream cheese!  Adding cream cheese to our rellenos makes them out of this world delicious!"
2711064,43026,2013-02-25,0,"I used to work at a Mexican Food Resteraunt in Littleton when I was in High School that is now out of business.  I worked in the kitchen and this recepi is very similar to what we used to make.  I'm not sure if they used egg roll wraps as our chili rellenos were actually prepared by someone in the family and brought in frozen several times a week.  I have been trying to replicate their recepi and never thought of egg roll wraps but that makes sense.  I'm going to try it tonight.  And we covered ours in home made green chili and garneshed with chopped lettuce.  Oh the resteraunt started with ""Mission"""
2001290680,43026,2017-03-14,0,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I worked in a little Mexican restaurant in Ovid, Colorado in the mid 2000's; we used Monterey Jack cheese and the egg roll wrappers. One canned whole chile, one small slice of cheese (maybe 1/4 inch thick and 1.5x3 inches or so), moisten the edges and fold into little &quot;envelopes.&quot; I miss those things! They my favorite after-work meal: 2 CR's with just a little green chili, a heaping helping of guacamole and some sour cream. A 16 year old's dream! Lol."
