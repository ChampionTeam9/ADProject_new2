I had a ham, egg, and cheese pizza at one of the pizza chain places on the concourse.  About $2.99 with coffee... It was one of the best breakfast dishes I ever had!  (But a strange place to find a delicious breakfast...lol)"

I too used uncooked sausage, but cooked it first and also added a few slices of cooked bacon pieces.  Tastes like the one at the local gas station.  Thanks for such an easy recipe."

Ovens vary but we had ours higher up and it still cooked fast. Thanks for posting Aroostook. It was perfect served with fruit salad. Kids and adults alike loved it. We could only find the pizza dough with one more ounce than called for so I made the crust built up a bit. No problems at all. Easily could add or change omelet type toppings i.e mushrooms, peppers,etc. Don't forget to season with salt and pepper. Super all around. Made for Zaar Cookbook game in the community forum. Enjoy!

4470,137739,2006-02-18,5," I used an acorn squash and recipe#137681 Sweet Mexican spice blend. Only used 1 tsp honey & 1 tsp butter between both halves,, sprinkled the squash liberally with the spice mix. Baked covered for 45 minutes uncovered or 15.  I basted the squash   with the the butter/honey from the cavity  allowing it to get a golden color.  Lovely Squash recipe Thanks Cookgirl"
593927,137739,2010-08-21,5,This was a nice change. I used butternut squash and the sweet option using a good local honey and unsalted butter. I did not add salt. We ate this on top of recipe#322603 with Balkan yogurt. I may make this again same option. Made for Ramadan Tag 2010.
